# To-Do-List

[Project Instructions](./INSTRUCTIONS.md), this line may be removed once you have updated the README.md

## Description

This project is a To-Do List application that allows users to create, complete, and delete tasks. It stores tasks in a PostgreSQL database, with dynamic updates to the DOM. Completed tasks are visually marked, and items can be deleted, reflecting changes in both the UI and the database.

Additional README details can be found [here](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/readme-template/blob/master/README.md).
