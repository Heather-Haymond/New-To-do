# To-Do-List

## Description

To-Do List Application with Full CRUD Functionality
This project is a simple To-Do List application that allows users to create, complete, and delete to-do items. The application features a seamless interaction between the front-end and back-end, where the to-do items are dynamically managed and stored in a PostgreSQL database.

Key Features:
✅Create To-Do Items: Users can add new to-do items by entering a text description and clicking the "Add Todo" button. Each new item is stored in the database and immediately displayed on the page.

✅Complete To-Do Items: Users can mark a to-do item as "completed" by clicking the "Complete" button next to it. This updates the isComplete field in the database to TRUE, and the visual appearance of the item changes (e.g., background color turns green, and the text gets a line-through effect).

✅Delete To-Do Items: Users can delete a to-do item, removing it from both the DOM and the database. A "Delete" button next to each to-do item allows for easy removal.

✅Dynamic UI Updates: The page dynamically updates when to-do items are created, completed, or deleted. The UI responds immediately after each action without needing a page refresh.

✅Visual Feedback for Completed Items: When a to-do item is marked as completed, it visually changes (e.g., background color, text decoration) to provide clear feedback to the user.

✅Backend Integration: The application is connected to a backend built with Node.js and Express, where the to-do items are stored and managed in a PostgreSQL database. The API endpoints handle all the necessary CRUD operations.

Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with Axios for API requests)
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL
CSS Styling: Basic styles for the to-do items, including dynamic classes for completed tasks.
This project demonstrates the full CRUD lifecycle of a to-do list, from creation to deletion, with real-time updates to the user interface. It offers an intuitive user experience with a clean, simple design for managing daily tasks.
